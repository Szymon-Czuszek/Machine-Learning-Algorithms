### Tree-Based Algorithms

The notebook [Tree.ipynb](Tree.ipynb) contains detailed implementations of various tree-based machine learning models. In this notebook, you will find techniques such as:
- Classification Tree: A decision tree algorithm for classification tasks.
- Random Forest: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.
- Boosting: A technique to combine the predictions of several base estimators to reduce bias and variance.
- Bagging
- Gradient Boosting
- Ada Boost
- XG Boost
- Grid Search: A method to perform hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models.

## Future Additions

This repository will be continually updated with more machine learning algorithms and techniques. Stay tuned for additions covering a wider range of models and methodologies.
