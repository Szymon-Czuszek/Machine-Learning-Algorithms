### Tree-Based Algorithms

The notebook [Tree.ipynb](Tree.ipynb) contains detailed implementations of various tree-based machine learning models. In this notebook, you will find techniques such as:
- **Classification Tree**: A decision tree algorithm for classification tasks.
```python
clftree = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth = 3)
clftree.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
- **Bagging**: A technique that involves training multiple versions of a predictor on different subsets of the data and combining their predictions.
```python
clftree = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth = 3)
bag_clf = BaggingClassifier(estimator = clftree,
                            n_estimators = 500,
                            bootstrap = True,
                            n_jobs = -1,
                            random_state = 42
                           )
bag_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees trained on different parts of the same dataset to improve classification accuracy.
- **Boosting**: A technique to combine the predictions of several base estimators to reduce bias and variance. It adjusts the weights of incorrectly classified instances so that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases.
- **AdaBoost**: A specific type of boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier by focusing on misclassified instances.
- **Gradient Boosting**: A boosting technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones, using gradient descent to minimize the loss function.
- **XGBoost**: An advanced implementation of gradient boosting that includes regularization to prevent overfitting and improve model performance.
- **Grid Search**: A method to perform hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models by exhaustively searching through a specified parameter grid.
